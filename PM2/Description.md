PM2 (Process Manager 2) is a popular process management tool for Node.js applications. It allows you to manage and monitor your Node.js applications easily, ensuring they run continuously without manual intervention. PM2 is useful in production environments for keeping your apps online, balancing load, and offering a range of features to manage processes efficiently.

Key Features of PM2:
Process Management: Start, stop, reload, and delete processes.
Automatic Restarts: If your app crashes or the server restarts, PM2 ensures your apps start back up.
Cluster Mode: It allows you to scale your Node.js app across multiple CPU cores, maximizing performance.
Monitoring: PM2 provides built-in monitoring of CPU and memory usage for each running process.
Logging: PM2 collects logs for your applications, helping in debugging and monitoring.
Zero Downtime: Through the reload feature, PM2 can restart apps with zero downtime, particularly in cluster mode.
Watch Mode: It can automatically restart your app when file changes are detected.
Load Balancing: PM2 helps to distribute incoming requests across multiple processes, improving performance and stability.
Startup Scripts: PM2 can generate startup scripts so that your Node.js apps will start automatically when the server restarts.
Basic PM2 Commands:

1. Install PM2:
   You need to install PM2 globally on your system using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install pm2 -g 2. Start an Application:
To start an application using PM2:

bash
Copy code
pm2 start app.js
Where app.js is your Node.js application file.

3. Check Running Processes:
   To list all running processes:

bash
Copy code
pm2 list 4. Stop an Application:
To stop a running process:

bash
Copy code
pm2 stop app.js
Or you can stop by using the process ID (PID):

bash
Copy code
pm2 stop <id> 5. Restart an Application:
To restart an app after you have made changes:

bash
Copy code
pm2 restart app.js 6. Reloading with Zero Downtime:
In a cluster mode environment, you can reload the app without downtime:

bash
Copy code
pm2 reload app.js 7. Monitor Processes:
To get a live overview of CPU and memory usage:

bash
Copy code
pm2 monit 8. View Logs:
To see the logs generated by your app:

bash
Copy code
pm2 logs 9. Auto Start on System Reboot:
You can configure PM2 to automatically start your apps when your server restarts. First, generate the startup script:

bash
Copy code
pm2 startup
Then save the current process list:

bash
Copy code
pm2 save 10. Remove an Application:
To delete an app from the process list:

bash
Copy code
pm2 delete app.js
Or using the process ID:

bash
Copy code
pm2 delete <id> 11. Running in Cluster Mode:
To scale an application across multiple CPU cores (cluster mode):

bash
Copy code
pm2 start app.js -i max
The -i max argument ensures that PM2 will run the app on as many CPU cores as available.

Example Workflow:
Install PM2:
bash
Copy code
npm install pm2 -g
Start your Node.js app:
bash
Copy code
pm2 start app.js
Monitor running apps:
bash
Copy code
pm2 monit
Make sure apps restart on reboot:
bash
Copy code
pm2 startup
pm2 save
PM2 simplifies Node.js application deployment and monitoring, ensuring stability and reliability in production environments.
