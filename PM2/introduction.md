Sure! Let’s break it down into simpler terms.

# What is PM2?

PM2 is like a helper tool for managing Node.js applications (which are programs written in a programming language called JavaScript).
Why Use PM2?
Keeps Apps Running: It makes sure your app is always on and running, even if it crashes or the server restarts.
Makes It Easy: You don’t have to manually start your app every time; PM2 can do that for you.
Handles Multiple Apps: If you have more than one app, PM2 can manage them all together.
Key Benefits:
Automatic Restarts: If your app stops working for any reason, PM2 can restart it automatically.

Performance Boost: It can run your app in a way that makes better use of your computer’s resources (like using more CPU power if available).

Monitoring: PM2 lets you see how your app is doing (like how much memory it’s using), so you can keep an eye on its health.

Logs: It collects messages from your app (logs) so you can check for errors or important events.

Easier Updates: When you need to make changes to your app, PM2 can help you do it without interrupting users who are using it.

Basic Commands:
Start an App: You can tell PM2 to start your app with a simple command.

Stop an App: If you need to stop your app, you can do that easily with PM2.

Check Status: You can check if your app is running or if it has any issues.

In Simple Words:
Think of PM2 as a smart manager for your Node.js applications. It keeps them running smoothly, watches over them, and makes sure they are always available for users. You don’t have to worry about them crashing or going offline because PM2 is there to help!
