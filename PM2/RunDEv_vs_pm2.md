npm run dev and PM2 serve different purposes when it comes to managing Node.js applications. Here’s a breakdown of their differences:

1. Purpose and Usage
   npm run dev:

Development Focused: This command is typically used during the development phase of an application. It is defined in the package.json file and runs a specific script to start your application, often with features like hot reloading and debugging.
Example: If you’re developing a web application, npm run dev might start a local server that reloads automatically when you change the code.
PM2:

Production Focused: PM2 is a process manager designed for production environments. It helps manage and monitor applications, ensuring they stay running continuously and can recover from crashes.
Example: PM2 allows you to start, stop, and manage multiple applications and can automatically restart them if they crash, making it ideal for production use. 2. Environment
npm run dev:
Local Development: Generally used on your local machine for development purposes. It usually runs in a development environment with specific configurations suited for building and testing your application.
PM2:
Production Environment: PM2 is meant for managing applications on a server. It’s optimized for running applications in production and comes with features that help maintain application uptime. 3. Features
npm run dev:

Hot Reloading: Automatically reloads your application when changes are made to the code, which is useful during development.
Debugging: Typically provides verbose logging to help identify issues while coding.
PM2:

Automatic Restarts: Automatically restarts your application if it crashes or the server is rebooted.
Monitoring: Provides real-time monitoring of CPU and memory usage.
Clustering: Can run multiple instances of your application across different CPU cores to improve performance.
Logging: Collects logs from your application for troubleshooting. 4. Commands
npm run dev:
Executes a specific script defined in package.json. For example, it might run a local development server using Node.js.
PM2 Commands:
Includes commands like pm2 start, pm2 stop, pm2 restart, and pm2 monit, which allow you to manage and monitor your applications effectively.
Example Scenarios:
Using npm run dev: You are developing a new feature for your web application and want to test it locally. You run npm run dev to see your changes in real-time.

Using PM2: Your web application is ready for production, and you deploy it on a server. You use PM2 to start the application, ensuring that it will automatically restart if it crashes and that you can monitor its performance.

In Summary:
npm run dev is great for local development and testing, providing a flexible environment to work in.
PM2 is essential for running applications in production, providing robust management, monitoring, and recovery features to keep your applications running smoothly.
