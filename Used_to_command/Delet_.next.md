# Delete .next folder

rmdir /s /q .next

The command rmdir /s /q .next is used in Windows Command Prompt to delete a directory (folder) and its contents. Here's a breakdown of each part:

rmdir: This stands for remove directory. It is the command used to delete a directory.

/s: This option tells rmdir to delete all files and subdirectories inside the specified directory. Without /s, rmdir would only remove an empty directory.

/q: This stands for quiet mode. It suppresses the confirmation prompt, which would normally ask you to confirm that you want to delete the directory and all its contents.

.next: This is the name of the folder that you want to delete. In this case, it's the .next directory, typically generated by Next.js for storing build-related data.

Full Command Meaning:
rmdir /s /q .next means:

Delete the .next directory and everything inside it (all files and subdirectories),
Without prompting for confirmation.
Itâ€™s a forceful and non-interactive deletion method, commonly used to remove folders with many files.
